Getting Started
===============

Introduction
------------

Before getting started with the pyvar package and learning more about its core and
examples, it is important to mention that one of the main focuses of this package
is to allow users to explore multiple ML applications use cases by using
displays, cameras devices, and user interfaces capabilities. We also must
briefly talk about a few more things such as the AI hardware accelerator,
model training, and model quantization, although those are extensive subjects.
